## Critical Issues Identified

### 1. **No Differentiation Between Playgrounds**
- All playgrounds feel the same
- No module-specific features or components
- Generic "objects", "workflows", "lwc" modules don't reflect actual content

### 2. **Missing Guided Learning**
- No step-by-step instructions
- No validation or feedback
- No progress tracking within playground
- No hints or tips system

### 3. **No Visual Context**
- All playgrounds just show generic Salesforce UI
- No callouts, arrows, or highlights
- No "what you're looking at" explanations

### 4. **No Interactive Elements**
- Can't actually "do" things
- No drag-and-drop builders
- No form validation
- No instant feedback

### 5. **Missing Module-Specific Features**
Each playground should have unique features:
- **Navigation**: Keyboard shortcut trainer, breadcrumb exercises
- **Data Model**: Schema builder, field creator, relationship wizard
- **User Management**: Profile matrix, role hierarchy builder
- **Process Builder**: Visual canvas, criteria builder
- **Apex**: Code editor with execution
- **LWC**: Multi-file editor with live preview
- **API**: Request/response tester

## Redesign Strategy

### Phase Structure

**Phase 2-3: Foundation Path (5 playgrounds)**
- Most critical as entry point
- Build foundational playground components

**Phase 4-5: Admin Path (2 playgrounds)**
- Focus on configuration and automation
- Build process and security components

**Phase 6-7: Developer Path (2 playgrounds)**
- Most complex - requires code editors
- Build development environment components

**Phase 8-9: Architect Path (1 playground)**
- Enterprise-level simulations
- Build integration and API components

**Phase 10: Testing and Documentation**
- Integration testing
- Documentation
- Final polish

---

## Next Steps

1. Start with Phase 2: Deep analysis of Foundation path lessons
2. Extract key learning objectives from each lesson
3. Design specific interactive elements for each playground
4. Create detailed implementation specs
5. Implement one playground at a time
6. Test and iterate

---

## Success Criteria

Each playground should:
✅ Have unique, module-specific features
✅ Include step-by-step guided instructions
✅ Provide real-time validation and feedback
✅ Show visual context (callouts, highlights, arrows)
✅ Enable actual interaction (build, create, configure)
✅ Track progress within the exercise
✅ Offer contextual hints and tips
✅ Relate directly to lesson content
✅ Feel different from other playgrounds
✅ Provide clear value to learner
